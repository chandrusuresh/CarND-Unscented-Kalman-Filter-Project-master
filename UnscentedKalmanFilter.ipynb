This demonstration is based on a simulator developed by Udacity and was completed as part of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. The [Udacity github repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) for this project has all the details about the software used in the simulator and the installation instructions.\n",

Udacity has provided bash scripts to install this in both [Linux](https://github.com/chandrusuresh/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project-master/blob/master/install-ubuntu.sh)/[Mac](https://github.com/chandrusuresh/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project-master/blob/master/install-mac.sh) environments. These scripts are included in this repo.\n",

        "1. Clone this repo.\n",
        "2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`\n",
        "3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`\n",
        "4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF`\n",
        "This should setup a listener for the code to get data from the simulator.\n",

The linearization is performed by linearizing a nonlinear function by linear regression of $n$ points drawn apriori from a distribution of a random variable. The UKF uses a deterministic sampling technique to pick a minimal set of \"sigma\" points around the current posterior mean. The sigma points are then propagated through the nonlinear function from which a new mean and covariance are computed. The resulting model more accurately estimates the mean and covariance. Another advantage of this technique over the EKF is that it does not require Jacobian computations.\n",
